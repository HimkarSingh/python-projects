# Snake Game

Welcome to the Snake Game! This project is a fun and interactive game built using Python and the Turtle library. The goal of the game is to navigate the snake, eat food, and achieve the highest score possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.

## Features

- **Dynamic Gameplay**: The snake grows longer with each piece of food it eats.
- **Colorful Food**: The food changes to a random color every time it spawns.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of your score as you play, with a game-over message displayed when the game ends.

## Prerequisites

To run this game, you'll need:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- The Turtle graphics library (pre-installed with Python).

## How to Play

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HimkarSingh/snake-game.git
   cd snake-game
   ```
2. Run the game by executing the `main.py` file:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. Use the arrow keys to control the snake:
   - **Up Arrow**: Move up
   - **Down Arrow**: Move down
   - **Left Arrow**: Move left
   - **Right Arrow**: Move right

4. Try to eat the food to grow your snake and increase your score. Avoid running into the walls or your own body.
