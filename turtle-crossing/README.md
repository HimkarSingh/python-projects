# Turtle Crossing Game

Welcome to the Turtle Crossing Game! This is a fun and engaging Python project that challenges the player to guide a turtle across a busy road without getting hit by cars. Each successful crossing advances the player to the next level, increasing the game's difficulty.

## Features

- **Player Movement**: Use the up arrow key to move the turtle forward.
- **Randomly Generated Cars**: Cars of varying colors appear randomly and move across the screen.
- **Increasing Difficulty**: With each successful crossing, the cars move faster, making the game more challenging.
- **Score Tracking**: The current level is displayed on the screen, and a "Game Over" message appears if the turtle collides with a car.
