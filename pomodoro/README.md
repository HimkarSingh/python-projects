# Pomodoro Timer

The **Pomodoro Timer** is a simple and effective productivity tool built using Python and Tkinter. It helps users manage their time efficiently by breaking work into focused intervals (Pomodoros) separated by short and long breaks.

---

## Features

- **Work Intervals**: Focused 25-minute work sessions.
- **Breaks**: Short 5-minute breaks and a long 20-minute break after every 4 work intervals.
- **Visual Countdown**: A dynamic timer displayed with a tomato icon.
- **Session Tracker**: Tracks completed work sessions using checkmarks.
- **Reset Functionality**: Allows users to reset the timer at any point.

## Prerequisites

To use the Pomodoro Timer, ensure you have:

- **Python 3.x** installed on your system.
- The `Tkinter` library (pre-installed with Python).

## How It Works

2. **Work and Break Intervals**: The timer will automatically switch between work intervals (25 minutes) and breaks (5 or 20 minutes).
3. **Track Progress**: Checkmarks appear below the timer to indicate completed work sessions.
4. **Reset**: Use the **Reset** button to stop the timer and clear progress.

## Code Overview

### Constants
- Defined colors, font styles, and time durations for work and break intervals.

### Functions
1. **reset_timer()**: Resets the timer, progress, and UI labels.
2. **start_timer()**: Determines whether itâ€™s a work or break interval and initiates the countdown.
3. **count_down()**: Handles the countdown mechanism and updates the UI dynamically.

### UI Setup
- Created using Tkinter with a tomato image for visual appeal.
- Buttons and labels are arranged to ensure an intuitive user experience.

## Future Enhancements

- Add sound notifications for session transitions.
- Implement a feature to customize work and break durations.
- Save session data to track long-term productivity.
